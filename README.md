### How to get started

make sure you have react installed<br>
npm install -g create-react-app

then run<br>
npm install
to install node modules

npm start

This will run React on local. However, it will not have any data.


### How to get the data for now while we're not connected to the Rails backend

Clone the api repo into the same folder as the react repo (There should be a folder with two repor in it, the react and the api). Be sure to not clone this in to the react folder.

run npm install to install json-server

npm start

Should now be able to run the app with some data
